# The Future of Programming
Uncle Bob Martin

## Color
Monitors and projectors always have 3 inputs. Sometimes they can be RGB or CMY. The number 3 seems to be more important than the specific colors. Why is this?

Human eyes only have 3 different types of color receptors, so we only understand color in terms of 3 channels.

## Current Demographics
Why are men so overrepresented in technology? Why are women so underrepresented?

## Looking Back

### 1936 - Turing Paper
"On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Enscheidungsproblem" – Alan Turing

- First paper that has the concept of macros and subroutines.
- Was not focused on computing but rather on math problems
- Further Reading: _The Annotated Turing_ by Charles Petzold

### 1939 - The Bombe
- Used relays to decrypt German messages
- 10ops per second on a relay

### 1942 - Collosus
- Used vacuum tubes
- Takes a lot of power
- 1Mops per second

### 1945 - ACE
- First machine Turing wrote programs for in binary
- Writing floating point math
- First actual vacuum tube machine

### 1945 - Mercury Delay Lines
- Pump bits as sound through a bunch of mercury
- Speaker puts it in, microphone picks it up and loops it through
- 1000 22 bit lines

### 1945 - Cathode Ray Tube Memory
- If you spray electrons at a screen, it will leave a pattern you can read later
- Cathode ray ≈ electrons
- Used CRT to output program results and manually inspected it

### 1945 - Turing
- Programmed in binary
- Invents stack
- Invents floats

> We shall need a great number of mathematicians of ability because there will probably be a good deal of work of this kind to be done.


> One of our difficulties will be the maintenance of an appropriate discipline so that we do not lose track of what we are doing.

- Number of computers in the world: O(1)
- Number of programmers in the world: O(1)

### 1950s
- Abandoned CRT and MDL for core memory
- If you lost everything, you had to toggle in the program in octal or hex
- Cost of > $1/bit
- Vacuum tube started to be mass produced and reliable
- Allowed computers to be built in quantity (dozens)

### 1953 - Fortran
- All IF statements were <=> with 3 way jumps
- Had non sequential line numbers
- Constrained by the cost of memory
- Written on pieces of paper with a #2 pencil
- Programmers did not know how to type
- Keypunch operators entered the programs onto punch cards
- Programmers were not allowed to use the computers. Operators ran the programs on the computers
- Turnaround time for a compile was 24-48 hours. Worked on 10-15 programs at a time.

### 1958 - LISP
- functional programming
- will not die. may be the final language ever

### 1954- 1960
- IBM sold 140 model 70x computers
- Ran Fortran and List


### 1960
- number of computers in the world: O(1E2)
- number of programmers in the world: O(1E3)
- Programmers were drawn from:
  - Engineers
  - Scientists
  - Mathematicians
- Entered industry as experienced professionals

### 1965 - Transistors
- IBM has produced 10k 1401s. Rented for about 20k/wk in $2016
- Allowed business to use computers for processes
- All in decimal. Bits are in binary, but everything is represented in decimals
- number of computers in the world: O(1E4)
- number of programmers in the world: O(1E5)
- Programmers?
  - Not enough existings professionals
  - Best and brightests of other fields
    - Accountants
    - Planners
    - Calculators
  - Still already part of the work force
  - Not mathematicians, but experiecned prof

 ### 1966
- IBM producing 1k 360s/month
- Simula-67 and Object Orientation developed

### 1968
- GOTO
    - Structured Programming
    - Called GOTO harmful
    - Marked all the standard paradigms of programming
- C
  - Invented by mathematicians
  - Curly brace languages

### 1970
- 50k PDPs/year
- number of computers in the world: O(1E5)
- number of programmers: O(1E6)
- Who were they?
  - Uncle Bob! at age 18.
  - Tens of thousands of new CS & EE Grads
  - All young
  - Almost all male
- At his first job: 24 programmers. Mostly 30s-40s. About 50% women
- Women were almost always about 50% of the computer workforce
- Software was considered womens' work. Men built hardware.

### 1980
- His company had 50 programmers
- All in their 20s or early 30s
- Only 4 women
- Business had to have programmers
- What very young men lack in discipline, they make up for in energy. Also cheap
- Now remember:
  - Programmers were professionals
  - Didn't need a lot of processes
  - They knew how to work together, mange their time
  - They understood priorities, deadlines
  - Knew how to get things done
  - Process used by them would have looked like Agile.
- The horde of young men need discipline imposed on them.
- Led to Waterfall and more processes

### Waterfall Era 1970-1995
- Number of programmers doubles every 5 years
- O(10E8) programmers in the world
- Half of whom have less than five years of experience
- What has changed?
  - Hardware
    - Now cheap. Commodity
    - Miniturized
  - Demographics
- What didn't change:
  - Software:
    - Nothing really had changed
    - Still recognizeable
    - Same skillset applies throughout the history of programming

### 1996
- Original cohort of disciplined professionals left
- Young men were no longer young.
- Didn't want process

### 2001 - Agile Manifesto
- Maturation the young programmers
- Enforces/requires discipline
- Technical disciplines came from this era:
  - TDD
  - Simple Design
  - Metaphor
  - XP
- While Agile process has started to be widely adopted, technical discipline parts have not been

## Right Now
- Business understands SCRUM
- Business doesn't understand technical discipline
- Programmers don't agree on best practices wrt technical discipline

> An efficient business discipline combined with undisciplined tehcnical process leads to a mess - Martin Fowler

- Civilization depends on software in ways that we do not yet understand.
- Nothing can be bought or sold without software

### Impending Disaster
- Only a matter of time until there is a software driven Disaster
- Reasonable response from politicians would be to regulate the software industry.
- Preemptive response would be to have standards, ethics, disciplines and rules around professionalism in programming
