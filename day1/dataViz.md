# Effective Data Visualization

Notes:
- Shades work really well cognitively. Better than color

## Graphical Integrity

### Lies
- Blantant lies: wrong data, misleading/omitting scale
- Lie: visualization may not be accurate. exaggerate magnitude
  - Lie Factor: size of effect shown in graphic/size of effect in data
  - Often comes from a misunderstanding of domain or statistic
  - Watch out for two dimensional objects on a single dimension of data

### Context
- Provide enough data to discern a trend.
- Provide useful similar comparisons

### Principles of Graphical Integrity
- Data Representations proportional to Data
- Real dollars instead of nominal dollars
- Provide context

## Data-Ink
- Data-Ink Ration = Data Ink / Total Ink
  - maximize as  much as possible within reason
- Avoid redundant data
- Metadata (descriptive data)
  - axes
  - grid lines
  - series description
  - labels
  - There is metadata that improves the utility of the visualization

### Principles
  - SHOW THE data
  - maximize the Data-Ink ration, within reason
  - iterate

## Vibrations
- Avoid legends. Label things directly
- Use the data to determine the look

## Multifunctioning Graphical Elements

## Data Density
- Number of entries in data matrix / area of data graphic
- No upper limit. Mind good at picking out patterns.
- Discrete points less useful than trends

## Small Multiples
- Provide multiple copies with small changes
- Allows to show change over time on 2d data sets
- Can be replaced with animation

## Takeways
- Don't lie
- Maximize Data-Ink ratio within reason
- Avoid Chart-junk and ducks
- User MF-GE if possible
- Keep labels with data
- Maximize data density

## Books
- Don't Make Me Think - Krug
- Tufte
- WSJ Visualization Book/Cookbook
